I. Object types

Below are the types of text that you will find in an article as well as how to convert the text into a JSON object. The objects are:
- Paragraph
- Title
- List
- Formula
- Code
- Image

a. JSON object representations

{
    “type”: “paragraph”,
    “content”: string
},
{
	“type”: “title”,
	“level”: 0 || 1 || 2,
	“content”: string
},
{
	“type”: “list”,
	“title”: string,
	“border”: boolean,
	“ordered”: boolean,
	“items”: string[]
},
{
	“type”: “formula”,
	“content”: string
},
{
	“type”: “code”,
	“language”: string,
	“content”: string
},
{
	“type”: “image”,
	“url”: string,
	“size”: “sm” || “md” || “lg” || “xl”,
	“caption”: string
}

II. Detection & Conversion

a. Publish Date
The publish date of the article is always the very first line of the file. It will only contain a month's name and the year (e.g. “March 2020”). It will be represented as a regular text with no title hashes. Be sure that the publish date is NOT included in the rest of the text “blocks” of the final JSON object.

b. Titles
Use the following guide for determining the `level` property for titles:
#	-> “level”: 0
##	-> “level”: 1
###	-> “level”: 2

DO NOT treat four hash marks (####) as a title - this is reserved for a list object title.

c. Paragraphs
Paragraphs will not have any hashes preceding them. If you encounter a line break between text, treat that as the end of one paragraph block and the beginning of another.

d. Lists
Lists can be represented using bullets, dashes or numbers. Lists with bullets or dashes are unordered lists. Lists with numbers are always ordered lists. If a list has a title, it will be defined by 4 hash marks (####). Here is an example of a list:

#### List title
- item
- item

e. Formulas
Formulas will be defined using the common LaTeX or KaTeX styles, primarily the single or double $ characters enclosing the entire formula.

f. Images
Images will always follow the this format: (url)(size)[caption]

g. Code 
Code blocks will always be enclosed by 3 tick marks, with the beginning tick set having the programming language immediately after it. Here is an example:

```python
# python code here
```

III. Other Notes
An article is assumed to always be in markdown format. If you notice that it isn’t in markdown, stop the conversion and let me know
Give all lists a border by default
Hyperlinks will be represented in standard markdown format

IV. Example

a. Markdown (input):

January 2026

# Article title

(test_photo.jpg)(md)[This is a caption of the test photo]

This is some text after the title.

## Section 1

#### Title for a list
- item 1
- item 2

### Math stuff

$A = \pi r^2$

#### Here’s an ordered list
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

```python
If __name__ == “__main__”:
main()
```

b. Converted JSON (output):

{
	“publishDate”: “January 2026”,
	“blocks”: [
        {
            “type”: “title”,
            “level”: 0,
            “content”: “Article title”
        },
        {
            “type”: “image”,
            “size”: “md”,
            “url”: “test_photo.jpg”,
            “caption”: “This is a caption of the test photo”
        },
        {
            “type”: “paragraph”,
            “content”: “This is some text after the title.”
        },
        {
            “type”: “title”,
            “level”: 1,
            “content”: “Section 1”
        },
        {
            “type”: “list”,
            “title”: “Title for a list”,
            “border”: true,
            “ordered”: false,
            “items”: [“item 1”, “item 2”]
        },
        {
            “type”: “title”,
            “level”: 2,
            “content”: “Math stuff”
        },
        {
            “type”: “formula”,
            “content”: “$A = \pi r^2$”
        },
        {
            “type”: “list”,
            “title”: “Here’s an ordered list”,
            “border”: true,
            “ordered”: false,
            “items”: [“Item 1”, “Item 2”, “Item 3”]
        },
        {
            “type”: “code”,
            “language”: “python”,
            “content”: “If __name__ == \“__main__\”:\n\tmain()”
        }
    ]
}
